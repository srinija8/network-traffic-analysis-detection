# Network Traffic Analysis & Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing network traffic to identify suspicious activity, understand attack patterns, and develop detection workflows used in Security Operations Centers (SOC).

Key areas include:

- Packet analysis using Wireshark and TCPdump
- Traffic investigation (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)
- Threat detection and anomaly identification
- Network-based incident investigation
- Detection documentation

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Wireshark
- TCPdump
- Zeek (planned)
- Python (analysis scripts)
- MITRE ATT&CK (network techniques)

---

## Analysis Goals
- Identify suspicious network behavior
- Analyze DNS and HTTP traffic patterns
- Detect abnormal authentication or scanning activity
- Document investigation workflows

---

## Example Detection Scenarios
- Port scanning activity
- Suspicious DNS requests
- Unusual outbound connections
- HTTP anomaly detection

---

## Investigation Workflow
1. Capture network traffic
2. Filter and analyze packets
3. Identify suspicious indicators
4. Correlate findings
5. Document investigation results

---

## Project Status
Project setup in progress — PCAP analysis and detection case studies will be added incrementally.
